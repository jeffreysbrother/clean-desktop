You're lazy. You take too many screenshots. You don't want your wife to find out that you're a messy loser with mental issues.

This little tool automates the process of moving files and folders on your desktop into a subdirectory named according to the current date. This allows for (fairly) easy retrieval at some later date. Get your act together! Un-clutter your life without losing track of all those screenshots of "social justice" warriors acting out on Twitter.
